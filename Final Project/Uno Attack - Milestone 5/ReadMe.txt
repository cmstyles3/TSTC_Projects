INSTRUCTIONS

This game is pretty simple right now.

When the game starts you will have 7 cards and the AI will have 7 cards.
One card will be placed on the discard pile.

In the lower left region of the screen is where you can see and cycle through the cards in your hand by pressing the left and right arrow keys.  The card that is brighter is the one that you currently have selected so if you press [ENTER] and the current selected card is playable it will be placed on the discard pile.  Also you can tell whos turn it is by highlighting the line in yellow that reads "player or ai hand has n cards".  When playing a wild card you select the color you want to change to by adjusting the current color with the up and down arrows.

Pressing escape will exit the application.
